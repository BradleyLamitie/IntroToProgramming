Tic-tac-toe (also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players,
<br> X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal,
<br> vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. (From Wikipedia)
